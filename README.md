Al-Jabr source has two different versions:

	---	2.2.1-4 >= version supports plugins and can be compiled only on Linux due to libc6 from
	 	which dlopen() function is used. This version is stable and highly recommended.

	---	2.1.1-5 version is cross-platform and can be compiled on Linux, Windows and Max OS X,
		but this version is unstable.
